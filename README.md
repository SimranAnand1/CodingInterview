# Coding Interview

I just started adding problems. Stay tuned for 10 days to get more problems.

### Why you should follow this repository?

As a student I solved many leetcode problems but unable to identify the most efficient solution and this repo will help you with explanation.

Often careercup contains buggy code and most inefficient algorithms. I try to add an effcient one with explanation in my own words. 

Feel free to add issues, comment and pull request.

* [Bit Manipulation](https://github.com/Surajr/CodingInterview#bit-manipulation)
